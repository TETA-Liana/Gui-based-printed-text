Project: GUI Text Scanner

This project demonstrates a simple application that scans printed text from a selected region on the screen and extracts the recognized text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

How It Works

Open the application GUI.

Select the area of the screen you want to scan.

The system captures the region and processes it using OCR.

The recognized text is displayed in the interface.
Python (or your chosen language) installed.

OCR library (e.g., Tesseract).

A working webcam or screen-capture tool (if needed).

A short printed text sample for testing.

Purpose

This project verifies that the GUI can correctly:

Capture a visual region

Process it

And extract readable text
